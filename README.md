# DotFiles
### 1. vis
audio visualizer for the cli you can download it using your package manager of choice.
### 2. spicetify
if you have installed spicetify correctly you will have a config-xpui.ini file in your .config/spicetify/ folder along with some themes
and color schemes. I use text theme with Nord colorscheme.
### 3. Rofi 
I haven't shown Rofi on my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/18zdsvc/kwinkdenerd_for_nord/) here but myTheme.rasi is 
config for a minimalist rofi with nord blue as the color scheme.
### 4. Alacritty and Starship
It is necessary to use a Nerd Font in alacritty for starship to work properly. Both are straightforward toml files, just replace them 
at the necessary location.

## Note: 
Vim nVim and Code all have nord themes which go extremely well with the other things I use.
